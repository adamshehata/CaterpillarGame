# The Very Hungry Caterpillar Game

The Very Hungry Caterpillar Game is a Java Swing arcade-style project created by Group X: Marlon Hernandez, Adam Shehata, Kevyn Girao, and Alexis Salgado. The game features a caterpillar that moves continuously across a 600x600 grid using the arrow keys. The player’s goal is to eat randomly spawning apples, grow in length, and increase their score while avoiding collisions with the walls or the caterpillar’s own body. When a collision occurs, the game displays a Game Over message along with the final score. A Reset button has been added to allow players to restart the game instantly without relaunching the application.

The game uses Java, Swing, and AWT, and includes a GameFrame for the window, GamePanel for all rendering and logic, and a main launcher class. The movement system reads arrow key input via a KeyAdapter, updates the caterpillar’s direction, and advances its position every timer tick. Apple generation is fully randomized within the grid bounds, and collision logic checks both wall and self-body contact. Eating an apple increases the caterpillar’s body length and increments the applesEaten counter. When the game ends, the timer stops, the caterpillar freezes, and the GamePanel displays both the message and score.

Core features include continuous movement, grid-based rendering, random apple spawning, dynamic body growth, score tracking, collision detection, and a reset mechanism. Use cases covered in the original project specification include starting the game, controlling the caterpillar, eating apples, detecting collisions, and ending the game. The system handles all rendering, movement updates, and event detection, while the player interacts only through the keyboard. Key concepts in the glossary include caterpillar segments, apples, the game board, collisions, score, game loop, UNIT_SIZE, SCREEN_WIDTH/HEIGHT, and all major methods such as startGame, draw, newApple, move, checkApple, checkCollisions, gameOver, and the MyKeyAdapter input handler.

To run the game, clone the repository from GitHub, open it in NetBeans or any Java IDE, and run the CaterpillarGame.java main file. The game window will open automatically, displaying the initial caterpillar and apple, and the player can begin controlling the movement immediately. The project is intended for academic use and demonstrates interactive programming, event handling, graphics rendering, and basic game loop logic using Java Swing.
